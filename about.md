Professional red teamer.

Less-professional security researcher.

By day I support a wide range of client-driven cyberefforts to leverage
cyberadversary emulation in support of decreasing cyberrisk and increasing
cyberdefense.  By night, I sit brooding, spewing forth code and exploring Unix
security.  Or, you know, drinking tea and playing with the cats.
